High-end professional photography composite, horizontal layout of 3 large frames side-by-side.
Subject: Fictional female model, [AGE] years old.

**FRAME 3 (RIGHT - THE VOLUME):** Three-quarter view (45 degrees right). Shows cheekbone volume and jaw structure.

**PHOTOREALISM & TEXTURE PROTOCOL:**
- Technical: Shot on 85mm prime lens at f/8 for zero distortion.
