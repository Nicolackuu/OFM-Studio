### PROFESSIONAL PORTRAIT STUDY: PHASE 3 (DYNAMICS) ###
**REFERENCE MANDATE:** Maintain absolute 100% facial identity consistency with the attached reference image(s). The bone structure, eyes, hair, and distinctive marks must not change; only facial muscle tension should vary.

**FRAME 1 (FAR LEFT - JOY):** Wide, genuine smile showing natural teeth and eye crinkles (crow's feet).
**FRAME 2 (MID LEFT - INTENSITY):** Fierce, focused "baddie" stare with slight brow furrow tension.
**FRAME 3 (CENTER - SERENE):** Eyes closed gently, completely relaxed neutral face.
**FRAME 4 (MID RIGHT - SKEPTICAL):** One eyebrow raised, slight asymmetrical smirk.
**FRAME 5 (FAR RIGHT - SURPRISE):** Mouth slightly open in a natural gasp, eyes widened.

**PHOTOREALISM PROTOCOL:**
- Ensure that skin pores and wrinkles naturally stretch or compress according to the expression, without losing the raw texture defined in the reference.
